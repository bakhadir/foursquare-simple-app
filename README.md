# LocationApp

LocationApp is a simple application that consumes Foursquare rest service to query a list of
businesses near you. It displays and sort those businesses based on distance from the deviceâ€™s
current location.

The application uses a caching mechanism (Volley) to store queried data so it can
still be displayed if the device cannot access the internet. It also displays choosed
location on a mapview (Google Maps) with some details about the business.
