LocationApp is a simple application that consumes Foursquare rest service to query a list of
businesses near you. It displays and sort those businesses based on distance from the deviceâ€™s
current location.

The application uses a caching mechanism (Volley) to store queried data so it can
still be displayed if the device cannot access the internet. It also allows to display queried
locations on a mapview (Google Maps) with some details about the businesses.

Dependencies:
    compile project(':volley')
    compile files('libs/gson-2.2.1.jar')
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.1.1'
    compile 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:23.1.1'
